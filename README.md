## 🚨 3. The Problem  

Private companies—especially in regulated industries—struggle to maintain a strong cybersecurity posture due to:

- **Fragmented Tools**: Scanners (network, web, SAST/DAST, cloud) operate in silos.  
- **Manual Processes**: Aggregating and prioritizing vulnerabilities is time-consuming and error-prone.  
- **Compliance Gaps**: Meeting GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001 standards remains tedious and inefficient.  
- **Increased Risk Exposure**: Slow remediation leads to data breaches, penalties, and reputation loss.
