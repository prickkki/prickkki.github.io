## 🚨 3. The Problem  

Private companies—especially in regulated industries—struggle to maintain a strong cybersecurity posture due to:

- **Fragmented Tools**: Scanners (network, web, SAST/DAST, cloud) operate in silos.  
- **Manual Processes**: Aggregating and prioritizing vulnerabilities is time-consuming and error-prone.  
- **Compliance Gaps**: Meeting GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001 standards remains tedious and inefficient.  
- **Increased Risk Exposure**: Slow remediation leads to data breaches, penalties, and reputation loss.

---

## 💡 4. The Solution / Value Proposition  

**Eostrix** provides a **unified vulnerability management hub** that consolidates all scanner outputs into a single, intelligent dashboard.  

**Core Value:**
- Centralizes vulnerability data from multiple scanners.  
- Automates compliance reporting for industry frameworks.  
- Streamlines remediation workflows and prioritizes critical risks.  
- Offers actionable intelligence and real-time alerts — boosting visibility, control, and compliance confidence.

# 🧭 Customer Discovery Process

## 1. Identifying the Problem  

The idea for **Eostrix** emerged directly from my professional experience at **Ford Motor Company**.  
During my work there, I noticed a major gap in how vulnerabilities were managed across different departments and systems.  
The existing tools were fragmented, and none provided a unified overview or effective prioritization method.  

> This first-hand exposure to the problem space revealed a clear need for a centralized, intelligent platform that integrates multiple scanners, reduces noise, and streamlines compliance reporting.

---

## 2. The Initial Solution Hypothesis  

Initially, I proposed to **develop an in-house solution** that would address Ford’s specific needs.  
After evaluating existing platforms, we found that none fully met the requirements, leading to the creation of a tailored internal product.  

This internal success became the foundation for **Eostrix**, designed to help other organizations facing similar challenges.

---

## 3. Customer Discovery Plan  

**Stage 1 — Internal Validation:**  
Collaborate with Ford teams to test prototypes and confirm internal pain points.  

**Stage 2 — External Validation:**  
Engage with other companies and professionals to assess how widespread the need is and how Eostrix could adapt to various organizational contexts.

---

## 4. Detailed Discovery Process  

### a. Identifying Customer Segments  
- Enterprise-level cybersecurity teams.  
- Mid-sized companies with compliance-driven operations.  

### b. Reaching Potential Customers  
I observed demand signals in the market by:
- Monitoring **LinkedIn job postings** from major companies like **Amazon** and **Stripe**, both seeking developers to build similar security platforms.  
- Receiving **direct LinkedIn messages** from professionals interested in implementing such systems.  

### 📸 Evidence  

Below are images gathered during the discovery process that validate external market interest:

| Description | Image |

### c. Collecting Information  

Interactions included:
- **Internal meetings** and workshops with Ford’s IT and security teams.  
- **Online discussions** with professionals in the cybersecurity space via LinkedIn.  

#### Key Questions Asked:
1. How do you currently manage and prioritize vulnerabilities?  
2. Which tools do you use, and what are their main limitations?  
3. How do you handle compliance reporting and audits?  
4. Would a single, centralized dashboard simplify your work?  
5. What features would make such a platform essential?  

#### Findings:
- Raw data access is critical for transparency and trust.  
- Teams need clear prioritization to eliminate noise.  
- Compliance automation is a key motivator.  
- User experience must be simple and flexible.

These findings directly influenced Eostrix’s roadmap:
- Introduced **data noise filtering** for improved prioritization.  
- Added **automated compliance reports** mapped to frameworks.  
- Built a **modular and intuitive UI**.  
- Adopted an **API-first approach** to ensure easy integration.  

At Ford, we are currently running a **beta version** internally, and Eostrix mirrors much of its proven functionality.

## 6. Readiness for Customer Validation  

While early validation shows strong interest and relevance, I plan to:
- Conduct **additional interviews** with external CISOs and IT leads.  
- Focus on making **adoption smooth and flexible** across organizations.  
- Launch a **public beta** to test usability and scalability.
