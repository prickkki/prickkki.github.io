# 🧭 Customer Discovery Process

## 1. Identifying the Problem  

The idea for **Eostrix** emerged directly from my professional experience at **Ford Motor Company**.  
During my work there, I noticed a major gap in how vulnerabilities were managed across different departments and systems.  
The existing tools were fragmented, and none provided a unified overview or effective prioritization method.  

> This first-hand exposure to the problem space revealed a clear need for a centralized, intelligent platform that integrates multiple scanners, reduces noise, and streamlines compliance reporting.

---

## 2. The Initial Solution Hypothesis  

Initially, I proposed to **develop an in-house solution** that would address Ford’s specific needs.  
After evaluating existing platforms, we found that none fully met the requirements, leading to the creation of a tailored internal product.  

This internal success became the foundation for **Eostrix**, designed to help other organizations facing similar challenges.

---

## 3. Customer Discovery Plan  

**Stage 1 — Internal Validation:**  
Collaborate with Ford teams to test prototypes and confirm internal pain points.  

**Stage 2 — External Validation:**  
Engage with other companies and professionals to assess how widespread the need is and how Eostrix could adapt to various organizational contexts.

## 🛠 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**The MVP Story:**
During our research, we discovered that developers were often paralyzed by complex security reports. After meeting a small entrepreneur who had to shut down his servers because he didn't know how to fix the vulnerabilities found. The Eostrix MVP was built not just to show data, but to act as a **Security Mentor**.
<img width="1114" height="629" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85caeab2-02d5-4a05-bf22-400020c64293" />


### MVP Characteristics:
1. **Unified API Integration**: Connects to major open-source and commercial scanners to prove data consolidation.
2. **Unified Dashboard**: A place where you can quick learn your situation.
3. **Reduces the noise**: A basic automated flow show you what to fix first.

### MVP Validation & Metrics:
- **Internal Traction (Ford)**: **600+ Beta Users** across **3 active teams** (Security, IT Ops, and Development).
- **External Validation**: **4 Interviews** with devs and small business owners.
- **Performance Impact**: Observed a **reduction** in Vulnerability Remediation Time (VRT) because developers no longer spend hours on research.

---

## 🧭 7. Customer Discovery & Validation

### The "Knowledge Gap" Discovery
Validation shifted significantly when we realized that **visibility without guidance equals anxiety.** Interviews with developers confirmed that the biggest bottleneck isn't finding the bug, but knowing the specific configuration fix for their environment.

### Internal "Pull" at Ford
A major validation milestone occurred when internal teams at Ford began submitting **feature requirements** for the beta. When users start requesting specific integrations (e.g., Jira exports, specific scanner APIs), it demonstrates that the product has moved from an experiment to a necessary tool in their daily workflow.
